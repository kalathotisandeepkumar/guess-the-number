#basic code for guessing the number by performing simple operations
#most of my friends have said that the guessing the number will be done by using AI, machine learning etc.
#but i have performed few mathematical operations so one can guess the number in other's mind..

#Python code:
#select the number from 1 to 9 in mind and dont say it me.
#and then sir multiply that selected number with '2'
#and then sir multiply that result with '5'
#ask your friend to enter that result 



n = int(input("enter the result after the mathematical operation"))
if(n==10):
  print("Your selected number is 1")
elif(n==20):
  print("Your selected number is 2")
elif(n==30):
  print("Your selected number is 3")
elif(n==40):
  print("Your selected number is 4")
elif(n==50):
  print("Your selected number is 5")
elif(n==60):
  print("Your selected number is 6")
elif(n==70):
  print("Your selected number is 7")
elif(n==80):
  print("Your selected number is 8")
elif(n==90):
  print("Your selected number is 9")
else:
  print("Please check the steps or mathematical calculation error")
